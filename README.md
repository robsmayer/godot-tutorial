Just testing and learning 

This is a tutorial from the official godot4 documentation!!

With some extra stuff.

## Tips from tutorial page
 - Also, under the Stretch options, set Mode to canvas_items and Aspect to keep. This ensures that the game scales consistently on different sized screens.

 - With Area2D we can detect objects that overlap or run into the player. Change the node's name to Player by double-clicking on it. -> That is the player node

 - ColorRect node. Make it the first node under Main so that it will be drawn behind the other nodes. ColorRect only has one property: Color. Choose a color you like and select "Layout" -> "Anchors Preset" -> "Full Rect" either in the toolbar at the top of the viewport or in the inspector so that it covers the screen.

 - You could also add a background image, if you have one, by using a TextureRect node instead.

Was really just a godot4 tutorial from the official documentation, but I'll add my own spin at it in 
another branch.
